# Yamakan

Yamakan is an AI-native creative production platform. Canonical repository: [TheHalfMoon/Yamakan](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Yamakan) (formerly `TheHalfMoon/Darzain`). The current product is an **offline local-web engineering preview**, not a release.

**Phase: implementation (P01).** The founder approved the final plan `edbaba6c` on 2026-10-11 ([decision record](docs/FOUNDER_DECISION_RECORD.md)). [CURRENT](specs/CURRENT.md) is the live frontier and [the master plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) is the sole task authority. The planning PRs #3–#5 are merged.

## Run locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:native
npm run build
npm start
```

`build:native` builds the Windows process owner and the workspace access helper (Rust toolchain with MSVC); media workers run only through the owner on Windows, and the service does not open a workspace it cannot make private to your account.

Open the launch link saved in the workspace's `launch` file (`http://127.0.0.1:4318/#launch=…`; the service prints where it is); the bare address shows only a sign-in notice. Each browser tab keeps its own session, so a new tab needs the link again. Agents use `npm run cli -- yamakan.project.list {}` or the MCP stdio server (`npm run mcp`) against the running service, separately from the browser session. The CLI authenticates with the workspace client token. The MCP server needs an agent token that can do only what you allow: make one in Finish → Agent tools → Agent access and point `YAMAKAN_AGENT_TOKEN_FILE` at a file holding it. To run MCP as the full local client instead, set `YAMAKAN_MCP_LOCAL_CLIENT=1`.

Local boundary: the workspace, its recovery folder and every file in them are private to your account (on Windows, access for you, SYSTEM and Administrators only; an elevated administrator can always read them). A workspace on a drive without permissions (FAT/exFAT), a folder owned by another account, or a link or junction is refused. A workspace that other accounts could read before this version may already be open in their programs (taking permissions away does not close what is open): if that matters, restore a backup into a fresh folder and use that. Keep the application folder itself (this checkout, `node_modules`, the built helpers) writable only by your account: anyone who can change the code that runs as you can read what you can.

Source/weight/service rights and capability availability remain distinct. No paid inference, cloud account or model weights are used.

## Planning package (historical)

The planning package below is preserved as reviewed at `edbaba6c`; `manifest.json` and `validation.json` describe that package, not later implementation.

Read the self-contained [research report](docs/RESEARCH_REPORT.md) for source names, bounded reuse qualifications, ranked risks, MVP scope and remaining work. Package integrity is recorded in manifest.json; validation.json distinguishes mechanical document validation from architecture or Claude approval. Historical documents are under docs/history; their old MVP/phase/tool statements do not control the new frontier.
